## Usage

  * Adding this script to your doc (once per doc):
    * Open your Google Drive document (http://drive.google.com)
    * Tools -> Script Manager > New
    * Select "Blank Project", then paste this code in and save.
    * Clear the myFunction() default empty function and paste the contents of `converttomarkdown.gapps` into the code editor
    * File -> Save
    
  * Running the script (run as many times as you want):
    - Markdown > Export File (Creates a new folder `target` in the same directory as the document. Markdown and image files are stored in it. A warning is generated if a `target` directory already exists) 
    - Markdown > Export Email (Sends you an email with the Markdown and image files)
    - Markdown > Latex Equation (Put your cursor on a equation and run the script. It will output the LaTex formatting in a dialog)
