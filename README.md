gdoc-markdown-converter
========

A Google Docs add-on to convert a properly formatted Google Drive Document to the markdown (.md) format. Then either download it or add it to your Google Drive. It also attached images which are 
available inside the doc. 

## Usage

## Interpreted formats
  * Text:
    * paragraphs are separated by two newlines
    * text styled as heading 1, 2, 3, etc is converted to Markdown heading: #, ##, ###, etc
    * text formatted with Courier New is backquoted: ``text``
    * links are converted to MD format: `[anchortext](url)`
  * Lists:
    * Numbered lists are converted correctly, including nested lists
    * bullet lists are converted to "`*`" Markdown format appropriately, including nested lists
  * Images:
    * images are correctly extracted and sent as attachments
  * Blocks:
    * Table of contents is replaced by `[[TOC]]`
    * blocks of text delimited by "--- class whateverclassnameyouwant" and "---" are converted to `<div class="whateverclassnameyouwant"></div>` 
    * Source code: 
      * **UPDATED**: blocks of text delimited by "--- source code" or "--- src" and "---" are converted to `<pre></pre>`
      * **NEW**: blocks of text delimited by "--- source pretty" or "--- srcp" and "---" are converted to `<pre class="prettyprint"></pre>`
    * Tables:
      * **NEW**: Simple `<table>` processing
  * "--- jsperf `<testID>`" is replaced by an iframe that shows an interactive chart of a JSPerf test. The `<testID>` is the last part of the URL of the Browserscope anchor in your JSPerf test. Something like `"agt1YS1wcm9maWxlcnINCxIEVGVzdBjlm_EQDA"` in the URL `http://www.browserscope.org/user/tests/table/agt1YS1wcm9maWxlcnINCxIEVGVzdBjlm_EQDA`
