## Usage

  * Adding this script to your doc (once per doc):
    * Open your Google Drive document (http://drive.google.com)
    * Tools -> Script Manager > New
    * Select "Blank Project", then paste this code in and save.
    * Clear the myFunction() default empty function and paste the contents of `converttomarkdown.gapps` into the code editor
    * File -> Save
    
  * Running the script (run as many times as you want):
    - Markdown > Export File (Creates a new folder `target` in the same directory as the document. Markdown and image files are stored in it. A warning is generated if a `target` directory already exists) 
    - Markdown > Export Email (Sends you an email with the Markdown and image files)
    - Markdown > Latex Equation (Put your cursor on a equation and run the script. It will output the LaTex formatting in a dialog)


## Interpreted formats
  * Text:
    * paragraphs are separated by two newlines
    * text styled as heading 1, 2, 3, etc is converted to Markdown heading: #, ##, ###, etc
    * text formatted with Courier New is backquoted: ``text``
    * links are converted to MD format: `[anchortext](url)`
  * Lists:
    * Numbered lists are converted correctly, including nested lists
    * bullet lists are converted to "`*`" Markdown format appropriately, including nested lists
  * Images:
    * images are correctly extracted and sent as attachments
  * Drawings: 
    * not supported - there seems to be no API function to export a drawing as a rasterized or vector image. 
  * Equations:
    * Equations are converted to LaTex equations and surrounded by ``$`` signs 
  * Table of contents:
    * Is replaced by `[[TOC]]`
  * Horizontal line: 
    * Inserts a `---`
  * Header/Footer:
    * Extracts text with all formattings and inserts it at the top and bottom of the markdown document, seperated by `---`.
  * Tables:
    * Converted to Markdown tables following GitHub Markdown syntax. Formatting within cells gets transferred.
  * Source code: 
    * Fenced code blocks are started by three back-ticks and a string and ended by three back-ticks. If such a fenced code block is detected, single line break is used within it.
