## Interpreted formats
  * Text:
    * paragraphs are separated by two newlines
    * text styled as heading 1, 2, 3, etc is converted to Markdown heading: #, ##, ###, etc
    * text formatted with Courier New is backquoted: ``text``
    * links are converted to MD format: `[anchortext](url)`
  * Lists:
    * Numbered lists are converted correctly, including nested lists
    * bullet lists are converted to "`*`" Markdown format appropriately, including nested lists
  * Images:
    * images are correctly extracted and sent as attachments
  * Blocks:
    * Table of contents is replaced by `[[TOC]]`
    * blocks of text delimited by "--- class whateverclassnameyouwant" and "---" are converted to `<div class="whateverclassnameyouwant"></div>` 
    * Source code: 
      * **UPDATED**: blocks of text delimited by "--- source code" or "--- src" and "---" are converted to `<pre></pre>`
      * **NEW**: blocks of text delimited by "--- source pretty" or "--- srcp" and "---" are converted to `<pre class="prettyprint"></pre>`
    * Tables:
      * **NEW**: Simple `<table>` processing
  * "--- jsperf `<testID>`" is replaced by an iframe that shows an interactive chart of a JSPerf test. The `<testID>` is the last part of the URL of the Browserscope anchor in your JSPerf test. Something like `"agt1YS1wcm9maWxlcnINCxIEVGVzdBjlm_EQDA"` in the URL `http://www.browserscope.org/user/tests/table/agt1YS1wcm9maWxlcnINCxIEVGVzdBjlm_EQDA`
