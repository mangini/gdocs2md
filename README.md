gdoc-markdown-converter
========

A Google Docs add-on to convert a properly formatted Google Drive Document to the markdown (.md) format. Then either download it or add it to your Google Drive. It also attached images which are
available inside the doc.

## Usage
  * How to install ?
    * Open any google document from your drive that can be converted into an MD file
    * Click on Tools -> Script Editor
    * Click on "Blank Project"
    * Delete all the contents in the file code.gs and paste all the contents from converttomarkdown.gapps file
    * Save the project and the file
    * There will be a drop down saying "Select Function"
    * Select the function "ConvertToMarkDown" from the drop down.
  * How to Use ?
    * After creating the project as said above, open the document where you have created the scripts.
    * Click on the Add-ons menu, you will see an add-on by the name of the project that you have created while installing.
    * Click on "Add To Drive" menu.
    * The file will be converted into an MD file with the name, same as that of the source document.
    * The converted file will be placed in a folder created with the name same as that of source document, under the folder "xt-docs-md-files"
    * If the above said folders are not there, the script will automatically create it.
    * If any inline image are there, it will also be placed within the folder where the converted MD file is placed already.
    * Please note that the converted images cannot be viewed directly from google drive. You have to download to view it because of this issue [http://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=1239]
    * To convert multiple documents, it is better to create this as a google docs plugin and publish it within your own domain after getting approval from google.
    * Cheers, Happy Converting.

    * links are converted to MD format: `[anchortext](url)`
  * Lists:
    * Numbered lists are converted correctly, including nested lists

    * Table of contents is replaced by `[[TOC]]`
